# Task

Here is a typical task that arises when creating a dataset with audio data. In the provided audio files, there are several sentences recorded, separated by periods of silence.
You need to write a script that takes the audio and returns the segmented sentences. Each resulting audio should not have silence at the beginning and end of the sentence. The script should be universal.
